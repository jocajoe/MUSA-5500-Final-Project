## Project Overview

This project examines whether proximity to breweries is associated with
median home values across Philadelphia census tracts. Using brewery location
data, American Community Survey (ACS) housing values, and census tract
geometries, the analysis explores spatial patterns of brewery accessibility
and neighborhood housing markets.

Rather than making causal claims, the project focuses on identifying
associations and visualizing how breweries and housing values co-locate
across the city.

## Research Question

- Are census tracts closer to breweries associated with higher median home values?
- How does brewery accessibility vary spatially across Philadelphia?


## Data Sources

This project integrates multiple publicly available datasets:

- Brewery locations from the Open Brewery DB API
- Median home values from the American Community Survey (ACS)
- Census tract boundaries from the U.S. Census Bureau

## Interactive Map

The interactive map below displays median home values by census tract,
with brewery locations overlaid. Clicking a brewery reveals nearby
neighborhood statistics within a walkable distance.

*Tip: Zoom in and click brewery markers to view neighborhood summary statistics.*



## Key Takeaways

- Census tracts closer to breweries tend to have higher median home values.
- Distance to the nearest brewery shows a moderate negative correlation
  with home values.
- Brewery presence appears to reflect broader neighborhood amenity patterns
  rather than acting as a direct driver of housing prices.
- Distance to the nearest brewery shows a moderate negative correlation with home values (r ≈ -0.39).
