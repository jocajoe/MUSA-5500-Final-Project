Areas with higher brewery accessibility are often centrally located, mixed-use neighborhoods that also benefit from other amenities, services, and infrastructure associated with higher housing values.\nAs such, brewery presence should be interpreted as part of a wider urban context rather than an isolated explanatory factor."

ACS values were joined to tract geometries using the tract GEOID. Missing or invalid values were treated as missing.\nKey variable - med_home_val (tract-level median home value)\n\n\nCensus Tract Boundaries\nCensus tract geometries were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s TIGER/Line products and filtered to Philadelphia County.

Brewery proximity may correlate with these broader neighborhood characteristics rather than independently driving prices.\n\nDespite these limitations, the pipeline provides a transparent and reproducible framework for comparing neighborhood-scale amenity accessibility and housing indicators."
