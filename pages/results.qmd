## Spatial Patterns

Median home values show clear geographic clustering across Philadelphia, with higher values
concentrated in central and river-adjacent neighborhoods.

Brewery accessibility also varies spatially. Many of the closest tracts to breweries appear
in areas with higher home values, suggesting potential co-location of amenities and housing markets.

## Association Between Brewery Proximity and Home Values

Across census tracts, distance to the nearest brewery is moderately associated with median
home values. Tracts closer to breweries tend to have higher median home values
(\(r \approx -0.39\)). A simple linear model with distance as the only predictor produces
\(R^2 \approx 0.154\), indicating brewery proximity explains a meaningful but incomplete
share of tract-level variation in home values.

## Walkability Threshold Comparison

To provide an interpretable accessibility measure, distance was also translated into a
walkability threshold. Tracts within 800 meters of a brewery tend to have higher median
home values on average, though the distributions overlap.

## Interpretation

Overall, breweries appear to co-locate with higher-value neighborhoods, but the relationship
is not deterministic. Brewery proximity likely reflects broader neighborhood amenity and
development patterns rather than acting as a direct causal driver of housing prices.
